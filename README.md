# CGA-Cryptographically-Generated-Address-   
## CGA generation process:  
The process of generating a new CGA takes three input values:   
ðŸŸ¢ 64-bit subnet prefix.  
ðŸŸ¢ public key of the address owner.   
ðŸŸ¢ security parameter Sec.    
##### Important Note:  The cost of generating a new CGA depends exponentially on the security parameter Sec, which can have values from 0 to 7.
